## Required Device Permissions

* ### Location (Allow Always)

In order to monitoring beacons to update the rooms status automatically while the app is inactive (not running) we need location permission to be authorized "**Always**" unless you want to open the app every time. It's totally up to you. First, it will ask you for "**While Using The App**" first, later it will ask you to change "**Always** (in Background)"

* ### Notification
You can enable local push notication to let know when you enter / exit the rooms in Settings.
